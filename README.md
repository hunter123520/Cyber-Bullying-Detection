# Cyber-Bullying-Detection

Enhancing Cyberbullying Detection with 1D CNN and BERT

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a novel approach to cyberbullying detection. This project was presented at the 2nd BÄ°LSEL International Scientific Research Congress in Diyarbakir, Turkey.

Key Features:

* 1D CNN for local feature extraction
* BERT for deep semantic understanding
* Sliding window bigram preprocessing for enhanced feature representation
Repository Contents:

* Cyberbullying_Detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code implementation.
To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (create a requirements.txt file listing necessary libraries)
3. Run the notebook: Open Cyberbullying_Detection.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
