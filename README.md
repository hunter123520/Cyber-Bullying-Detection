# Enhancing Cyberbullying Detection with 1D CNN and BERT

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of a novel approach to cyberbullying detection. This project was presented at the 2nd BÄ°LSEL International Scientific Research Congress in Diyarbakir, Turkey.

**Key Features:**

* **1D CNN:** Efficiently captures local patterns in text sequences.
* **BERT:** Leverages powerful contextual understanding for semantic analysis.
* **Sliding Window Bigram Preprocessing:** Improves model performance by extracting meaningful features.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hunter123520/Cyber-Bullying-Detection```

2. **Install dependencies:**
 ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the notebook:**
  Open Cyberbullying_Detection.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
